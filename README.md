# Secure cloud-based infrastructure for CTSA hub data sharing
CTSAs are struggling to leverage cloud based data sharing architectures to support federated ownership of datasets, both technologically and socially through proper scalable governance solutions aimed at research use. CTSAs are missing out on capitalizing on the many innovations and efficiencies the cloud offers for both existing and future software tools for big data, which include elasticity, scalability, state-of-the-art cybersecurity capabilities, economies of scale (e.g., paying for utilization only). This project will lay foundation of processes and physical cloud architecture that supports secure data sharing across institutions in the cloud. 

## Project description
CTSAs use federated networks within and between themselves with little to no ability to interoperate, bottlenecked by human analysts for access to aggregated and raw datasets. CTSAs are struggling to leverage cloud based data sharing architectures to support federated ownership of datasets, both technologically and socially through proper scalable governance solutions aimed at research use. CTSAs are missing out on capitalizing on the many innovations and efficiencies the cloud offers for both existing and future software tools for big data, which include elasticity, scalability, state-of-the-art cybersecurity capabilities, economies of scale (e.g., paying for utilization only).
